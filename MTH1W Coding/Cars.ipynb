We want only the second and fourth item in each of the 182 elements. We can use a for loop to cycle through each element and put only the items we do want into a new list.\n\nTo reference a range of items, rather than adding them separately, I can use a colon in between two indices. For example,\n\nmy_list.append(row[1:5])\n\nwould add the elements with indices 1 through 4 (notice the 5 in the brackets means up to, but not including index 5) from the row to my_list.\n\nI can also use a \"step\" by adding another colon. For example,\n\nmy_list.append(row[1:5:2])\n\nwould add every second elements with indices 1 through 4 - i.e. it would add my list[1], skip over my_list [2], add my list[3], and skip over my_list[4].\n\nThe for loop is set up for you in the kernel below, but is missing the indices inside the square brackets.
